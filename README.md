Week 01. Introduction to the course
 * Up to now the course has used the NodeRED rapid application development environment. This unit looks at how to program for the Internet of Things platform using more traditional programming environments


Week 02. Rapid application development in the cloud
 * An Internet of Things solution usually requires a back-end server to receive and process data coming from sensors. Cloud platforms allow new solutions to be created and deployed very rapidly without having to worry about how to host the application. This series of lessons introduces you to a cloud based Platform as a Service and an open source rapid application development environment called NodeRED.



Week 03. Rapid application development on a Raspberry Pi
 * This unit looks at how to add a device to your solution. Creating an application on a Raspberry Pi and establishing secure, trusted communication between your cloud application and devices



Week 04. Lower level programming for the Internet of Things
 * Up to now the course has used the NodeRED rapid application development environment. This unit looks at how to program for the Internet of Things platform using more traditional programming environments
