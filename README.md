## Week 02. Rapid application development in the cloud
 * An Internet of Things solution usually requires a back-end server to receive and process data coming from sensors. Cloud platforms allow new solutions to be created and deployed very rapidly without having to worry about how to host the application. This series of lessons introduces you to a cloud based Platform as a Service and an open source rapid application development environment called NodeRED.

              * Node-RED is a visual tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services â€“ for wiring the [Internet of Things](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things). Node-RED provides a browser-based flow editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range nodes in the palette. Flows can be then deployed to the runtime in a single-click. JavaScript functions can be created within the editor using the a rich text editor. A built-in library allows you to save useful functions, templates or flows for re-use.
              The light-weight runtime is built on [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), taking full advantage of its event-driven, non-blocking model. This makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network on low-cost hardware such as the [Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi) as well as in the cloud. With over 120,000 modules in Node's package repository, it is easy to extend the range of palette nodes to add new capabilities. 
              The flows created in Node-RED are stored using [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) which can be easily imported and exported for sharing with others. An online flow library allows you to share your best flows with the world.
